# fuzzy
This code is a fuzzy logic system that calculates a drug dose based on a patient’s temperature. It fuzzifies the temperature into membership degrees, applies inference rules (Max–Min or Max–Product) to determine a fuzzy dose, and then defuzzifies the result into a crisp value. The system also visualizes the fuzzy sets and the final output.
