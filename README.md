# fuzzy
This Python code implements a fuzzy logic system that suggests the appropriate drug dose for a patient based on their temperature. It uses the main stages of fuzzy logic: fuzzification, inference, and defuzzification. First, it defines fuzzy sets for temperature (low, high) and drug dose (low, high), with two alternative versions available so the user can experiment. Fuzzification is performed through linear interpolation, converting the crisp input temperature into membership degrees for the fuzzy sets. Inference then combines these fuzzy values with the dose sets using one of two possible methods: Max–Min or Max–Product. This process produces a fuzzy output for the possible drug doses. Defuzzification is then applied using the centroid method, which computes a single crisp value (the recommended drug dose) from the fuzzy output distribution. The code also provides visualization: it plots the fuzzy sets for temperature and dose, as well as the resulting fuzzy output with the final crisp dose marked. The main function interacts with the user, asking for the patient’s temperature, the choice of fuzzy sets, and the inference method. Finally, it displays the calculated membership degrees, the crisp drug dose, and graphical representations of the reasoning process. In summary, the program demonstrates how fuzzy logic can be applied in a medical context to adjust medication dosage based on imprecise input data like body temperature.
